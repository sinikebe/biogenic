extends Node
## The network probe: two sessions, one headless process, over ENet on
## loopback.
##
## **It asserts positives and CI greps for them.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
## documents twice, from measurement, that Godot exits 0 straight through script
## errors -- a duplicate function in a booted scene's own script produces a
## SCRIPT ERROR and exit 0. A network test that only ran would go green while
## testing nothing, so every check below prints `[net-probe] PASS <name>` or
## `[net-probe] FAIL <name>`, and the last line is `[net-probe] ALL PASS`, which
## is the only thing CI trusts.
##
## **What it cannot see, and the list is longer than what it can.** Everything
## here happens inside one process on 127.0.0.1, so it says nothing at all
## about: latency, jitter, packet loss, reordering, MTU, NAT, Wi-Fi roaming,
## Android's `onActivityStopped` pausing the whole main loop, thermal
## throttling, battery, or the one bug that matters most --
## `godotengine/godot#105726`, ENet clients disconnecting at random over a real
## LAN, which is **documented not to reproduce on localhost**, which is exactly
## this recipe. It also cannot see whether a phone's Wi-Fi is on a /24. Two real
## devices on real Wi-Fi for thirty minutes is the test this is not.
##
## What it *can* see is the whole of the local contract: that the handshake
## completes, that a shout crosses and decodes to the numbers that went in, that
## the heartbeat keeps arriving, and -- the highest-value assertion in the file
## -- that a peer on a different protocol is refused with a sentence instead of
## hanging.
##
## Excluded from export (`tools/*` on both presets), so none of it ships.
